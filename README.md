# Launchpad

Manage your game platforms and create beautifully-simple .exe files to launch games from any platform 
within Steam or other applications.

Every launcher in the list creates a small .exe file you can add right to Steam that handles the entire launch process seamlessly. Or if you don't want to use another platform, you can run all of your launchers directly from Launchpad!

## Introduction

Gone are the days when your entire game library exists in the form of game discs--digital downloads are 
where it's at. But there are many different options for where and how to download and play PC games. And
frustratingly, many games are specific to certain distribution platforms, meaning gamers are often forced
to run several different game platforms on their PC simultaneously.

This is where Launchpad comes in. It helps you take control of your games and game platforms, letting you
launch your games the way you want, without the usual pitfalls and compatibility issues that come along with
trying to make game platforms work well together.

Launchpad can handle almost any advanced launch scenario you can throw at it!

Launchpad can be used as a game launcher itself (you can run all your launchers directly from the UI!),
but what's cool is that each game launcher exists as a self-contained .exe file with the right name and icon,
and you can add it right to Steam or any other platform that allows external games.

## Why Use Launchpad

Let's take Steam as an example, because that was the original use case for Launchpad's creation.

Adding Non-Steam games to Steam often works well, but it is a bit quirky, and sometimes features are broken
or it might not work at all. Some common issues include:
- Some games that open via URL or the Windows Store can't be added to Steam.
- Some games cause Steam to say you're playing only for a moment and then stop even though you're still in-game. 
  In these cases, playtime cannot be tracked and your friends don't know you're playing a game.
- Some games launch in ways where the Steam overlay doesn't hook into their process
- Some games that use external launchers continue to say you're playing the game after you exit--sometimes for 
  days if you don't notice.
- Changing a game's icon in Steam adds a shortcut arrow that obscures the icon and makes it obvious it doesn't 
  belong

Launchpad was created to solve all of these issues and more. It gives you a simple way to create a lightweight .exe 
file for any game taht looks and acts the way you want. You can add these files to Steam, or any other launcher. Or 
you can simply launch them directly to help you control how your games run.

## Features

Launchpad is getting new features all the time. Some of its main functionality includes:
- A simple, themeable GUI for managing your games and launchers, as well as optionally displaying progress while 
launching your games. The default theme fits in great with Steam!
- Generate .exe files to launch any type of game from any PC game platform
- Manage and detect installed games from Steam, Epic, Origin, Blizzard, and Bethesda.net effortlessly
- Add custom games from any other platform without editing a single config file
- Sync games with Launchpad's online launcher API to pre-configure advanced details automatically
- Fully automate a game's launcher (such as starting it or closing it before or after running the game, with 
customizable behaviors and delays)
- Run games from shortcut, .exe file, URI, or a custom command. Run games directly, or as a scheduled task. Take over 
process ownership from another launcher
- Run and/or close a custom list of programs (such as performance hogging apps or music apps) before and/or after running 
a game
- And more!

## How To Use

If you're a new user, head over to the Releases page and simply download and run the latest Launchpad-x.x.x.exe
installer file. Then, run the Launchpad icon on your desktop to get started!

The setup screen that runs on first launch will walk you through some initial options and get you started 
detecting your games and creating your first launchers.

Once youv'e got some launchers created, simply Build All, and you will have a .exe file for each game launcher
that you can add to Steam or any other platform.

## Updating Launchpad

Launchpad uses an installer to make it easy to get started. There is no automated update process yet, but 
you can always download the latest installer and install it over the top of your existing installation.

Launchpad currently does not notify you when a new release is available, so make sure to check periodically.
Update notifications are coming soon!

## Note on Portability

Launchpad's configuration files are portable, but the launchers that Launchpad
generates from them might not be. Some functionality in Launchpad relies on dependencies existing in the right
place, and even if the same game is installed on another computer, that computer may not necessarily be able to use
your generated launcher file.

If you reinstall your OS or move your games, you'll probably want to open Launchpad and rebuild your launchers to
make sure they are fully up-to-date.

## Credits

Launchpad was conceived and developed by Ben McClure of Volantis Development (ben@volantisdev.com) using the 
powerful scripting language AutoHotKey.

Launchpad automatically downloads a few dependencies for use during its operation. The dependencies it installs are:
- [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
- [IconsExt](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/iconsext.html)
- [Protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)

These dependencies each use different licensing from Launchpad, and they have their own release cycles, so Launchpad 
doesn't include them in your initial download.

Launchpad downloads and manages these dependencies internally, and you don't ever have to even think about them.
